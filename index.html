<h1 style="color:red;">POVERTY | CORRUPTION | GENDER EQUALITY </h1> 
<p> This is a visualisation created by Muhammad Hyqel Bin Razali for Data Visualisation 2 which depicts several world problems that would be deeemed as important to address
  in today's context.<br> Based on the 'Top 10' world problems, Poverty, Government Corruption and Gender Equality were among the few that concerns everyday citizens, especially
  among millenials and the generations <br>that follows after. With that, there will be several graphs and charts available to show the world's progress in tackling
  these very critical but relevant issues. </p>

 <h2><u>POVERTY</u></h2>
  <h3><u> Comparison of Accessibility to Electricity in 2011 & 2018 </u> </h3>
  <p> The following visualisation will compare the various accessibility to electricity for the major parts of the world. We can see that there is an increase in the number of accessibility as the world progresses.
  <br>As seen in the choropleth map below, we can see that there is a huge lack of accessibility to electricity in the Africa region. One of which is 'Chad' in Africa which has only improved by 8% (from 3% to 11%) <br>of its population in 8 years. 
  With that, it is evident that the world needs to start shifting its attention to providing these basic necessities to the people in Africa.</p>

  <h3><u> GDP per person vs Invest Percentage among Countries </u></h3>
  <p> To know more the economy standing of the various countries, we explore the income per capita in international dollars. These data is adjusted
  for inflaction and differences in the cost of living between countries, so-called PPP dollars. <br>Also in the graph below, a variable for Investment percentage is added.
  This investment is describing the capital formation where it is used to describe the net capital accumulation during an accounting period for a particular country.<br> Generally,
  the higher the capital formation of an economy, the faster an economy can grow its aggregate income. With these two variables in hand, we would want to see
  the relationship that goes between 'GDP per person' and <br>'Invest percentage of the country' .As we can see, majority of the countries have a GDP per person but their investment rate 
  is at a low +/- 20%. That being said, Bhutan is an outlier in this case with an extremely high investment percentage with a below <br>than average GDP per person.</p>

<h2><u>Gender Equality</u></h2>
<p> Equality among the sexes has alwayas been a common topic especially in today's context. United Nation calls for it to be not only a fundamental right, but a necessary
  foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.<br>How much has it changed since? This is where we will look at a visualisation that will depict the number of places in the world that gives the same rights to both men and women for several categories; Equal rights for employment,<br> remarry and living spaces. 
  When we look at the numbers below, notice that there is an increasing number of countries from 2001 to 2019. Such figures would be deemed as a higher success rate in light of several
  feminist movements<br>happening all around the world. </p>
