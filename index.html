<h1 style="color:red;">POVERTY | CORRUPTION | GENDER EQUALITY </h1> 
<p> This is a visualisation created by Muhammad Hyqel Bin Razali for Data Visualisation 2 which depicts several world problems that would be deeemed as important to address
  in today's context.<br> Based on the 'Top 10' world problems - Poverty, Government Corruption and Gender Equality were among the few that concerns everyday citizens, especially
  among millenials and the generations <br>that follows after. With that, there will be several graphs and charts available to show the world's progress in tackling
  these very critical but relevant issues. </p>

 <h2><u>POVERTY</u></h2>
  <h3><u> Comparison of Accessibility to Electricity in 2011 & 2018 </u> </h3>
  <p> The following visualisation will compare the various accessibility to electricity for the major parts of the world. We can see that there is an increase in the number of accessibility as the world progresses.
  <br>As seen in the choropleth map below, we can see that there is a huge lack of accessibility to electricity in the Africa region. One of which is 'Chad' in Africa which has only improved by 8% (from 3% to 11%) <br>of its population in 8 years. 
  With that, it is evident that the world needs to start shifting its attention to providing these basic necessities to the people in Africa.</p>

  <h3><u> GDP per person vs Invest Percentage among Countries </u></h3>
  <p> To know more the economy standing of the various countries, we explore the income per capita in international dollars. These data is adjusted
  for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries, so-called PPP dollars. <br>Also in the graph below, a variable for Investment percentage is added.
  This investment is describing the capital formation where it is used to describe the net capital accumulation during an accounting period for a particular country.<br> Generally,
  the higher the capital formation of an economy, the faster an economy can grow its aggregate income. With these two variables in hand, we would want to see
  the relationship that goes between 'GDP per person' and <br>'Invest percentage of the country' .As we can see, majority of the countries have a high GDP per person but their investment rate 
  is at a low +/- 20%. In comparison, Bhutan is an outlier in this case with an extremely high investment percentage with a below <br>than average GDP per person.
  That being said, much emphasis would need to go to the African countries where their income per capita is still among the lowests across all continents but yet, percentage of investments
  are on-par with other higher GDP per person countries. </p>

<h3> <u>Relationship between Children leaving school education and Percentage of young working chidren in Top 10 Poorest Countries </u></h3>
  <p> Another variable that could be looked at to measure poverty is the percentage of young working children in the Top 10 Poorest Countries - which can be seen below.
  Analysing the relationship on the percentage of children <br> leaving education and the dependency ratio on the young for support could shed some light on the relation both
  variables have on each other. Evidently, it seems that majority of the points are not following a certain pattern. Based on this, we will not <br> be able to conclude
  substantially that most of the children quitting school is due to the work commmittments as a child. Regardless, it is still vital that this visualisation exists to show
  the critical ever-lasting ratio of child labour of an average of 80% across all top 10 poor countries which <br> we would hope to be eliminated in the next few years to come. </p>

<h2><u>Corruption</u></h2>
<h3> <u>Corruption Index among Countries from 1996 - 2019 </u></h3>
<p> Corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal offense undertaken by a person or an organization entrusted with a position of authority, to acquire illicit benefit
  or abuse power for one's private gain. <br> There have been many instances of corruption all over the world from 1MDB fund with Malaysia's former Prime Minister to Myanmar's dirty jade business.
  These acts of corruption apparently are in the minds of everyday citizens <br> as these issues could lead up to damaging the country economically and eventually decreases
  the public's trust on the governing body. With that, protest and instability could happen frequently in these countries. <br> With, we would take a look at 20 countries
  to see if they have made any improvements on dealing with corruption from 1996 till 2019. As can be seen in the heat map below, countries that acquire a low corruption index
  tend to remain low despite being more than 20 years apart. </p>

<h2><u>Gender Equality</u></h2>
<p> Equality among the sexes has always been a common topic especially in today's context. United Nation calls for it to be not only a fundamental right, but a necessary
  foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.<br>How much has it changed since? This is where we will look at a visualisation that will depict the number of places in the world that gives the same rights to both men and women for several categories; Equal rights to be the head of the household, employment,<br> travelling,remarry and living rights. 
  When we look at the numbers below, notice that there is an increasing number of countries from 2001 to 2019. Such figures would be deemed as a success number  in light of several
  feminist movements<br>happening all around the world. With that, we hope that in the few few years to come, more countries would join in the ranks to addressing
  equality among the sexes.</p>
